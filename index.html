                <h4>Hello! My name is Natasha Kelly and this is my story with Lupus.</h4>

                <p>My story starts in <time>2007</time> when I was a freshman at Rutgers University in New Brunswick. I was 17 years when I was diagnosed with Lupus SLE. My life changed drastically from that moment.
                It became filled with doctor's appoinments and medications. I was devastated at how much of my life was now revolving around a disease I had never heard of before. After my diagnosis, I took a medical leave from Rutgers to adjust and focus on my health.</p>
                <p>In <time>2009</time>, I was accepted into Kansas State University. I was still battling Lupus however I had a team of dedicated doctors and a medical regimen that allowed me to return to school. I continued on to graduate in <time>2013</time> with a B.S. in Apparel Marketing. I was preparing to move from the Little Apple to California.</p>
                <p>I arrived in California with no family but with the support of my sorority sisters. Things seemed to be going so well for me at this time I had an internship and I was adjusting to my life in California. However in <time>September of 2014</time>, I was hospitalized at Standford University hospital with kidney failure.
                I was told that I had lost 78% functionality of my kidneys and I needed to be placed on dialysis. I was 25 and on dialysis. I remember crying on my way to treatment and asking God why me? I could not understand why all of this was happening considering no one in my family had kidney issues or Lupus.</p> 
                <p>Despite how awful this felt, I continued to show up for my treatments. I had no idea if I would be on dialysis for the rest of my life but I decided I would just take it one day at a time.
                3 months later I was taken off of dialysis! This felt like a fresh start for me. I started my new job at Facebook shortly after and decided I would learn to code that year. I wanted to live life to the fullest and I did! I stayed in California
                for 3 more years when I decided to move back home to New York. </p><p>I started my journey with Flatiron School to pursue a career as a Software Engineer. I was very focused on getting a job and the stress of it all took its toll on me. In <time>2016</time>, I was hospitalized and placed on emergency dialysis. I felt the lowest I had ever been in my life. Here I was celebrating my birthday, Christmas and New Years in the hospital.
                I made a promise to myself that when I got out of the hospital I would continue to fulfill my dream to be an engineer. Ater my recovery period, I applied for Grace Hopper Academy and was accepted in <time>October 2017</time>. My life changed in many ways after this, I finally became a software engineer and remained on dialysis.</p> 

                <p>I have shied away from telling my story because I never wanted to be seen as different. I never saw myself that way and I did not want people to think of me as different. But I have come to realize that my story, is a story of hope and perseverance. 
                I am sharing my story with you with the hopes that you will see myself in you.</p>
