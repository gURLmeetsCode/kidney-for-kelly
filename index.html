                Hello! My name is Natasha Kelly and this is my story with Lupus. My story starts in 2007 when I was a freshman at Rutgers University in New Brunswick. I was 17 years when I was diagnosed with Lupus SLE. My life changed drastically from that moment.<br>
                It became filled with doctor's appoinments and medications. I was devastated at how much of my life was now revolving around a disease I had never heard of before. After my diagnosis I took a medical leave from Rutgers and took time to adjust and focus on my health.<br>
                In 2009, I was accepted into Kansas State University. I was still battling Lupus however I had a team of dedicated doctors and a medical regimen that allowed me to return to school. I continued on to graduate in 2013 with a B.S. in Apparel Marketing. I was preparing to move from the Little Apple to California.<br>
                I arrived in California with no family but with the support of my sorority sisters. Things seemed to be going so well for me at this time I had an internship and I was adjusting to my life in California. However in September of 2014, I was hospitalized at Standford University hospital with kidney failure.<br> 
                I was told that I had lost 78% functionality of my kidneys and I needed to be placed on dialysis. I was 25 and on dialysis. I remember crying on my way to treatment and asking God why me? I could not understand why all of this was happening considering no one in my family had kidney issues or Lupus.<br> 
                Despite how awful this felt, I continued to show up for my treatments. I had no idea if I would be on this for the rest of my life but I decided I would just take it one day at a time.<br>
                November 2014 I was taken off of dialysis! This felt like a fresh start for me. I started my new job at Facebook and decided I would learn to code that year. I wanted to live life to the fullest and I did! I stayed in California
                for 3 more years when I decided to move back home to New York. I wanted to become a software engineer and started my journey with Flatiron School. I was very focused on getting a job and the stress of it all took its toll on me. In 2016, I was hospitalized and placed on emergency dialysis. I felt the lowest I had ever been in my life. Here I was celebrating my birthday, Christmas and New Years in the hospital.<br>
                I told myself if I made it out of this hospital I would get back on my feet again. When I got out of the hospital it wasn't long before I wanted to continue with school. I applied for Grace Hopper Academy and was accepted in October 2017. My life changed in many ways after this, I finally became a software engineer and remained on dialysis.<br> 

                I have shied away from telling my story because I never wanted to be seen as different. I never saw myself that way and I did not want people to think of me as different. But I have come to realize that my story, is a story of hope and perseverance.<br> 
                I am sharing my story with you with the hopes that you will see myself in you.<br><br>

                I am a Lupus Warrior<br>

                I am a Software engineer<br>

                I am on dialysis<br>

                I am a daughter<br>

                I am just like YOU!
